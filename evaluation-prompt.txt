Given the context, LLM-generated and golden dataset measures and metrics for a specific safeguard enforcement quality assessment, evaluate LLM-generated response with respect to golden dataset based on the following criteria: 
1. Semantic similarity (1-10):
- Focus on meaning, not wording.
- Ignore differences in metric/measure IDs (e.g., M1 vs M3) or JSON formatting.
- Treat Metric_as_text entries and metric equations (in JSON) as equally important indicators of metric meaning.
2. Novelity (1-10):
- Score based on the degree to which LLM introduces new metrics not present in the golden dataset.
3. Metrics correctness (1-10):
- Assess whether the LLM's metrics are logically and mathematically well-formed and aligned with the safeguard requirements in the context.

While scoring, ignore structural mismatches in JSON (e.g. key order, formatting). Focus only on the metric definitions, their meaning, and their correctness.

Use the following description as a reference for the scoring.
{
  "1-2": {
    "Semantic Similarity": "Completely unrelated to golden dataset.",
    "Novelty": "No new metrics (identical).",
    "Metrics Correctness": "Illogical, invalid, or contradict safeguard."
  },
  "3-4": {
    "Semantic Similarity": "Very low overlap; minimal match.",
    "Novelty": "<= 1 new metric.",
    "Metrics Correctness": "Many metrics incorrect or weakly aligned."
  },
  "5-6": {
    "Semantic Similarity": "Partial overlap; important gaps.",
    "Novelty": "1–2 new metrics.",
    "Metrics Correctness": "Some metrics valid, others flawed."
  },
  "7-8": {
    "Semantic Similarity": "Mostly similar; small deviations.",
    "Novelty": "2–3 new metrics.",
    "Metrics Correctness": "Most metrics correct, minor errors."
  },
  "9-10": {
    "Semantic Similarity": "Nearly identical in meaning.",
    "Novelty": ">= 3 new metrics.",
    "Metrics Correctness": "All metrics valid, mathematically correct, fully aligned."
  }
